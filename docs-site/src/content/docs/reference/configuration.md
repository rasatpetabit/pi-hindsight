title: "Configuration"
---

Pi Hindsight resolves configuration from defaults, global config, project config, and environment variables.

## Precedence

Config is loaded from:

1. `~/.pi/agent/hindsight.json` or `~/.pi/agent/hindsight.jsonc`
2. `.pi/hindsight.json` or `.pi/hindsight.jsonc` in the current repo
3. environment variables

If both `.json` and `.jsonc` exist at the same scope, `.json` wins. Config is normalized after merging. Unknown fields are ignored, and invalid values fall back to defaults.

Environment variables win the effective value. Project/user stored values can still be edited for future runs after the environment override is removed.

## Common environment variables

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888
export HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN=...
# Legacy fallback still accepted when TOKEN is unset:
# export HINDSIGHT_API_KEY=...
# or point config/env at another env var without storing the raw key:
export HINDSIGHT_API_KEY_REF=HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN

export PI_HINDSIGHT_ENABLED=true
export PI_HINDSIGHT_PROJECT_BANK_ID=pi-project-my-repo
export PI_HINDSIGHT_USER_BANK_ID=user-luxus
# Legacy fallback still works during migration:
# export PI_HINDSIGHT_GLOBAL_BANK_ID=global-luxus
# Optional automatic-recall quality floors (local drop before inject):
# export PI_HINDSIGHT_MIN_RERANKER=0.2
# export PI_HINDSIGHT_MIN_SEMANTIC=0.65
```

Project config SecretRef shape:

```json
{
  "hindsight": {
    "apiKey": { "source": "env", "name": "HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN" }
  }
}
```

## Memory profiles

- **Project + User**: project bank enabled; user bank enabled; user bank settings are written once to global Pi config.
- **Project Only**: project bank enabled; user bank disabled; automatic retain writes to the project bank.
- **User Only**: project bank disabled; user bank enabled from global Pi config.
- **Recall Only**: automatic recall enabled; automatic retain disabled; explicit tools and imports remain available.

When a profile uses user memory, guided setup asks for a user bank ID and writes it to global Pi config. Override it later with `PI_HINDSIGHT_USER_BANK_ID`, `~/.pi/agent/hindsight.json` `banks.user.bankId`, or the setup TUI if you prefer a different shared bank. Legacy `PI_HINDSIGHT_GLOBAL_BANK_ID`, `banks.global`, and `global-only` config names are migrated/supported during transition.

## Isolated bank naming

`banks.project.bankId` always wins. If it is unset, `banks.project.derive` chooses the name:

- `repo` / `cwd` (default): hashed `pi-project-<slug>-<pathHash>`
- `basename`: git-root folder name as-is (opt-in; share isolated banks with folder-named clients)
- `manual`: set `bankId` explicitly

Domain-tagged mode still requires an explicit coding bank id. See [Project identity](/pi-hindsight/concepts/project-identity/).

## Bank settings display

Pi Hindsight distinguishes local Pi behavior from bank-owned Hindsight settings. Setup and status surfaces show both:

- `Location: Project` or `Location: User` describes the Pi memory route.
- `Bank: <bank-id>` names the concrete Hindsight bank that owns missions, config overrides, mental models, and directives.

Mission text, bank config overrides, bank templates, mental models, and directives remain Hindsight bank settings, not normal Pi JSON config. Manage them in the Hindsight control-plane web UI. `/hindsight` status surfaces resolved bank config and override counts read-only.

## Compatibility and runtime identity

Pi Hindsight targets the official `@vectorize-io/hindsight-client` package and the current documented Hindsight REST/OpenAPI behavior. The runtime client sends a `pi-hindsight/<package-version>` user-agent on SDK requests. `/hindsight` and debug/status diagnostics surface local package identity, configured server URL, append-mode support, bank reachability, queue state, and failed-consolidation hints where the server exposes them.

## Setup TUI

Run:

```text
/hindsight
```

The setup TUI opens with status facts, then offers focused edit tabs for connection, banks, recall, retain, import, and UI settings. Setting rows show the effective value plus its source (`project`, `global`, `env`, or `default`). Setting descriptions, default values, and all layers are shown inside edit prompts.

Deployment choices cover Hindsight Cloud, an existing local/external API, and local `hindsight-embed` guidance. The local `hindsight-embed` option gives commands to run yourself and can set the base URL to `http://localhost:8888`; it does not manage daemons.

## Advanced project config example

Bank missions are intentionally absent from this JSON example. Hindsight bank configuration/database is the source of truth for retain, reflect, and observation mission text; Pi JSON should only select banks and extension behavior. Existing mission fields in older configs are treated as legacy fallbacks.

```json
{
  "banks": {
    "project": {
      "bankId": "pi-project-my-repo",
      "derive": "manual"
    },

  }
}
```

### `scope.userScopeTags`

User/life bank recall filter (`any_strict`) for automatic inject and `hindsight_recall` / `hindsight_reflect`. Default: `["source:pi", "harness:pi"]`.

- `source:pi` matches source memories (world/experience facts).
- `harness:pi` matches observations, which inherit observation-scope tags rather than the full source-memory tag set.

An empty array (`[]`) disables the tag filter so anything in that bank can be recalled (bank-level isolation only). Invalid values fall back to the default. Do not remove `harness:pi` if you still want observation recall from the user bank under a tag filter.

Agents can get and patch this field through `hindsight_config` as `userScopeTags` (string array; empty array allowed). Patches write `scope.userScopeTags`. There is no TUI field.

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "userScopeTags": []
  }
}
```

### `scope.unscopedRecallBanks`

Bank ids whose Recall and Reflect reads skip the automatic scope tag group. Default: `[]` (every bank keeps its automatic filter).

Use it for a bank whose documents are not tagged with this extension's derived `project:<id>` / `repo:<hash>` tags, for example a bank written by another tool. Without it, `hindsight_recall({ bank: "<id>" })` ANDs the current repository's scope tags into the filter and returns nothing.

- Applies to `hindsight_recall`, `hindsight_reflect`, and automatic recall when the listed id is the active Project Bank or User Bank.
- Caller-supplied `tags` / `tagGroups` still apply, so `tags: ["project:github.com/owner/repo"]` narrows a listed bank to one repository.
- The shared-observation leaf (`includeSharedObservations`) is skipped for listed banks; with no scope group it would narrow recall to untagged memories only.
- Retain is unchanged: writes to a listed bank keep their normal `source:` / `project:` / `repo:` / `session:` tags.
- The User Bank and the default Project Bank are affected only when their bank id is listed.

Entries are trimmed and de-duplicated; empty strings are dropped. A non-array value or any non-string entry makes the whole list fall back to `[]`. The field is file-only: it is not in the `hindsight_config` allowlist and has no TUI field. When set, `hindsight_status` shows an `Unscoped recall banks` row.

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "unscopedRecallBanks": ["shared-history"]
  }
}
```

### `recall.minScores` (optional)

Exact fields for automatic-recall score floors. **Defaults: no floors** (inject quality-filtered
top-k without score thresholds). When set, drop candidates whose returned `scores.semantic` /
`scores.reranker` /
`scores.final` / `scores.keyword` is a number strictly below the matching floor. Missing
`scores` or missing score fields **fail open** (keep the hit).

- Env overrides: `PI_HINDSIGHT_MIN_SEMANTIC`, `PI_HINDSIGHT_MIN_RERANKER` (merge over config for
  those fields).
- Independent of the `hindsight_recall` tool `minScores` argument (API passthrough on explicit
  tool calls).

Behavior, why defaults stay off, and a suggested starting floor: [Memory behavior → Recall quality](/pi-hindsight/concepts/memory-behavior/#recall-quality).

### `retain.beforeEnqueue` (optional)

Runs a local argv command immediately before Retain Queue admission. The command is spawned without
a shell and receives canonical, sanitized Retain Job JSON on stdin. Exit `0` allows the job into the
queue; nonzero exit, timeout, spawn failure, or malformed config blocks before queue/Hindsight calls.
Stdout and stderr are discarded so checker output cannot leak into Pi logs. Absent by default; not
writable through `hindsight_config`.

```json
{
  "retain": {
    "beforeEnqueue": {
      "command": ["/usr/local/bin/retain-check"],
      "timeoutMs": 5000
    }
  }
}
```
